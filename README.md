## Entry Points for Contributors

**Start anywhere. Fork freely. No permission needed.**

### Story Entry Points

- Write a chapter where Nkemjika encounters a community that has learned to 'tune' the ghost signals for agriculture, with unintended consequences.
- Create a side-story about the old man in the terminal, revealing he was one of the 'first programmers' who accidentally tapped the spirit logic.
- Draft a 'memory' from the stone: the moment a 2060s AI governance model, designed for Accra, achieved a fleeting, terrifying consciousness.
- Write a scene in the 'ghost continent' city, where a shimmering, glass figure made of data tries to explain its longing to be real to a captured traveler.

### Technical Entry Points

- Design a speculative interface for 'network ethnography'—a device that visualizes data streams as ancestral spirits or environmental forces.
- Propose a system of 'Adinkra Code'—a programming or markup language where symbols like Sankofa or Gye Nyame define functions for memory-handling and error-correction.
